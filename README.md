The programs (and my modifications) for the book Beginning C++ Through Game Programming

The source codes in this repo are my modifications of the source code found in the book. Some may have many modifications, some may not have any.

The book is in its third edition and was published in 2013.

All source codes will be in C++ and are intended soley for learning the language.
